Fake news is becoming a more serious issue in today's world. Validity is an application that makes it easier to sift through the fake news and educate yourself on topics you may have misunderstood. We use a TensorFlow model to determine the probability that a certain online article is fake news. If the model does think there is a good chance it is fake news, it will recommend other, more accurate articles on the same topic.
